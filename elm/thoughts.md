# Thoughts on using Elm

Overall, I had a great experience using Elm. There definitely was a learning curve at the beginning since I haven't used a purely functional language before. It definitely required a shift in the way I was thinking, even though I have used languages which contain some functional elements and concepts previously.

I don't really expect Elm to go anywhere, the ecosystem is like a recently abandoned town, where things mostly still work but there's not much recent activity.

## Good things

Type system is fun to play with, generating types that fully cover the scenarios I want and no more (discriminated unions are fantastic).
The packages work well and are pretty simple to use.

## Bad things

The vscode lsp extension isn't very clean, it requires to save the file to get useful results and tends to spam you with red squiggly lines. The guides and tutorials online are a bit mixed, sometimes it's difficult to find what I needed and often they weren't as clear as I would have liked, getting bogged down with the boilerplate.
The interop with javascript things using ports, such as the localstorage API is quite awkward to use.
