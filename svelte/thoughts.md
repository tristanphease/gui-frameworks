# Thoughts on using Svelte

Svelte is definitely cool, it smooths out a lot of the inconveniences in vanilla javascript/typescript. Using the runes are cool and fairly intuitive. I feel like pretty much every modern web framework has a declarative model for the UI which just makes sense since it's a lot easier to write.

I didn't utilise the tauri stuff much; just used it for running natively. Could've done more with this potentially but would require desktop specific requirements.

## Good things

Components are neat and simple. I like most of the decisions made by the svelte system. List of things I liked:
- Component per file standard
- Importing json
- Runes
- Declarative
- CSS being local to the component

## Bad things

Almost doesn't feel a big enough departure from standard html / css. It definitely makes a lot of things a lot more simple but inherits a lot of the same issues with css, html and js/ts.
